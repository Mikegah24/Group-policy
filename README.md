# Group-policy

### What is Group Policy?
Group Policy is a feature in Active Directory that lets administrators control settings for users and computers across the network. It’s used to enforce security rules, configure system behavior, and automate restrictions — all from a central location.

In this lab, Group Policy is used to:

- Enforce strong passwords and lockout rules

- Apply restrictions to certain departments (OUs)

- Simulate real-world IT controls and security policies

This ensures that all users follow the same rules automatically when they log into the domain.

### PASSWORD POLICY
